# Cyberfortress ElastAlert2 Rules

A concise collection of ElastAlert2 rule files used by the Cyberfortress project. Each rule is provided as a YAML file inside the `rules/` directory and is intended for use with an ElastAlert2 deployment.

Usage:
- Place the YAML files from the `rules/` directory into your ElastAlert2 rules folder or configure ElastAlert2 to point to this directory.
- Review and adapt indices, fields, and thresholds to match your environment before enabling rules.

Repository layout:
- `rules/` — YAML rule definitions (one file per rule).

Contributing:
- Pull requests and improvements to rules are welcome. Please test rules in a safe environment before submitting changes.
